Welcome to the history page. Here you will get all the info of how PlayProductions got started. I hope you enjoy:

It all started when Yaseen Bougouizi (Thats me!) was desperate for a buisness. He tried his hardest to get an idea but
nothing.Then all of a sudden when Yaseen was playing on his PS3 he got an idea. He thought that if over 63 million
people play video games why doesnt he create one himself. So he was off getting prepared; Researching, geting notebooks and 
pens and ect. So he started, he was working on a game called The Explorer but arfter 2 months he found out he hasnt even 
created a level yet so he gave up. So he kept on researching and every artical he reads and every program he watches they all
say the same thing "Never give up!" so he decided to carry on. So he started to write in his notebook ideas of new games and
characters. But every idea he thought of seemed to be missing something. Day after day after after day he didnt get what he was
missing until he finally got it was a partner. So singned himself up for code club and mabey scout out some people to help him.
