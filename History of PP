Welcome to the history page. Here you will get all the info of how PlayProductions got started. I hope you enjoy:

It all started when Yaseen Bougouizi (Thats me!) was desperate for a buisness. He tried his hardest to get an idea but nothing.
Then all of a sudden when Yaseen was playing on his PS3 he got an idea. He thought that if over 26 million people play video
games why doesnt he creat one himself.
